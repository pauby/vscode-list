A list of useful extensions, tricks,  tips and tutorials gathered from the interwebs.

## Tips

* [Multiline find and replace](https://twitter.com/mattbierner/status/1248339906184839169)
 VS Code's find/replace widget supports searching for multiline text. Use CTRL+Return to insert a newline while typing or just paste in some multiline text.

## Extensions

* [CodeTour](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/codetour)
  CodeTour is a Visual Studio Code extension, which allows you to record and playback guided walkthroughs of your codebases. It's like a virtual brownbag, that can make it easier to onboard (or reboard!) to a new project/feature area, visualize bug reports, or understand the context of a code review/PR change. A "code tour" is simply a series of interactive steps, each of which are associated with a specific file/line, and include a description of the respective code. This allows developers to clone a repo, and then immediately start learning it, without needing to refer to a CONTRIBUTING.md file and/or rely on help from others.
